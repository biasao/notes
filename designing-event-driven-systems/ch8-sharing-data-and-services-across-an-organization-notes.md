## Notes
- _"This is no panacea; in fact, many implementations of the microservices pattern suffer from the misconceived notion that modularizing software over the network will somehow improve its sustainability. This of course isn’t what microservices are really about."_
- _"Microservices are run by different teams, have different deployment cycles, don’t share code, and don’t share databases."_
- _"Data on the outside is hard to change, because many programs depend upon it. But, for this very reason, data on the outside is the most important data of all."_
