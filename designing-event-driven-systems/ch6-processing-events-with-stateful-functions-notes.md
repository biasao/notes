## Notes
- _"EJB, while touted as a panacea of its time, fell quickly by the wayside as systems creaked with the pains of tight coupling and the misguided notion that the network was something that should be abstracted away from the programmer."_
  - [Fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)
- _"Two styles of programming that better suit distributed design, particularly in a services context, are the dataflow and functional styles"_
- _"So Kafka provides the equivalent of a pipe in Unix shell, and [stream processors provide the chained functions.](https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-samza-and-the-unix-philosophy-of-distributed-data/)"_
- "Streaming systems embrace a polyglot culture, be it via different programming languages or different datastores."
