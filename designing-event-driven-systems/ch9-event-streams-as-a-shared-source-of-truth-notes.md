## Notes
- _"So stream processing flips the traditional approach to data and code on its head, encouraging us to bring data into the application layerâ€”to create tables, views, and indexes exactly where we need them."_
- _"The key insight is essentially the same: stream processing segregates responsibility for data storage away from the mechanism used to query it."_
