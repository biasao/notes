## Notes
- _"A broker is a separate piece of infrastructure that broadcasts messages to any programs that are interested in them, as well as storing them for as long as is needed. So itâ€™s perfect for streaming or fire-and-forget messaging."_
- _"So Kafka is a mechanism for programs to exchange information, but its home ground is event-based communication, where events are business facts that have value to more than one service and are worth keeping around."_
- [Kafka is a streaming platform](https://www.confluent.io/blog/stream-data-platform-1/)
- "Kafka Streams and KSQL ... These APIs can be stateful, which means they can hold data tables much like a regular database"
- _"The difference is that ESBs focus on the integration of legacy and off-the-shelf systems, using an ephemeral and comparably low-throughput messaging layer, which encourages request-response protocols_
_... Kafka, however, is a streaming platform, and as such puts emphasis on high-throughput events and stream processing. A Kafka cluster is a distributed system at heart, providing high availability, storage, and linear scale-out_"
- _[event streaming as a source of truth](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/event-streaming-as-the-source-of-truth)_
- _"This is emphasized by the core mantra of event-driven services: Centralize an immutable stream of facts. Decentralize the freedom to act, adapt, and change."_
